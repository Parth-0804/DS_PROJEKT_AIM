Project Suggestion: IPL Match Outcome Predictor & Interactive Dashboard 

A practical and engaging AI/Data Science project for a group of three, using open-source IPL datasets, is to build a Match Outcome Predictor with an accompanying Interactive Data Dashboard. This project leverages widely available ball-by-ball and match-level IPL data and can be completed within two months by a small team. 

Project Overview 

Objective: Predict the outcome of IPL matches (win/loss) using machine learning and visualize key match/player statistics through an interactive dashboard. 

Data Sources: Use open-source IPL datasets such as those available on GitHub and Kaggle, which provide both match-level and ball-by-ball data in CSV and JSON formats135. 

Team Roles: 

Data Engineer: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and integration. 

Data Scientist: Model building and evaluation. 

Dashboard Developer: Visualization and dashboard creation. 

Step-by-Step Project Plan 

1. Data Collection & Understanding 

Download IPL datasets (2008â€“2024) from open sources like Kaggle or GitHub135. 

Datasets include: 

matches.csv: Match-level details (team names, venue, toss, winner, etc.). 

deliveries.csv: Ball-by-ball data (batsman, bowler, runs, wickets, etc.). 

2. Data Preprocessing 

Merge datasets using match_id for richer feature sets4. 

Clean data (handle missing values, standardize team/player names). 

Engineer features such as: 

Recent performance metrics (e.g., runs/wickets in last 5 overs). 

Toss decision, venue, head-to-head stats. 

Player form (e.g., average runs/wickets in the season). 

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Analyze trends: 

Team performance over seasons. 

Impact of toss decisions. 

Venue-wise win rates. 

Top players by runs/wickets. 

Visualize findings using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). 

4. Model Building 

Problem: Predict match outcome (win/loss for Team 1). 

Approach: Use classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). 

Features: Team strengths, toss, venue, player stats, recent form. 

Evaluation: Train/test split, cross-validation, accuracy, F1-score. 

5. Interactive Dashboard 

Build a dashboard (using Streamlit, Dash, or Power BI) to: 

Display match predictions. 

Visualize player and team statistics. 

Allow users to select teams, venues, and see predicted outcomes and historical stats3. 

Optional: Add a "What-if" feature to simulate different scenarios (e.g., change playing XI or venue). 

6. Documentation & Reporting 

Prepare a project report covering: 

Data sources and preprocessing steps. 

EDA insights. 

Model performance. 

Dashboard features and usage guide. 

Why This Project? 

Feasible: Open datasets are available and well-documented135. 

Comprehensive: Covers data engineering, machine learning, and visualization. 

Collaborative: Each member can own a distinct part of the workflow. 

Showcases Skills: Demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, ML, and dashboarding. 

Example Use Cases & Extensions 

Predict the final score of an innings using regression models4. 

Identify key factors influencing match outcomes (feature importance). 

Analyze player performance trends and visualize career trajectories. 

This project will not only strengthen your skills in data science and AI but also provide a visually engaging and interactive tool for IPL fans and analysts.
