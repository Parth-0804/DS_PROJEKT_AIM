Strategy Optimization & Decision Support System for IPL: Project Roadmap 

This project combines predictive analytics with tactical decision frameworks using IPL data. While moderately complex due to multi-layered analysis, it’s achievable in 2 months with structured planning. Here’s how to approach it: 

Step-by-Step Implementation 

1. Data Foundation (Weeks 1-2) 

Sources: 

Match/ball data: matches.csv, deliveries.csv (Kaggle/GitHub12) 

Auction data: IPL player salary records (merge with performance stats). 

Preprocessing: 

Handle missing values (e.g., substitute player nationalities). 

Engineer features: 

Player: Strike rate (last 10 matches), economy variance, injury history. 

Team: Win % at specific venues, powerplay scoring trends. 

2. Strategy Optimization Models (Weeks 3-4) 

Tactical Scenarios: 

Batting Order Optimization: Use Markov chains to simulate inning progression. 

Bowling Changes: Cluster batsmen weaknesses (e.g., spin vs pace) using k-means. 

Auction Insights: 

Predict player valuations with regression (XGBoost/Random Forest)2. 

Simulate bidding wars with Monte Carlo methods. 

3. Decision Support Dashboard (Weeks 5-6) 

Tools: Streamlit (Python) or Power BI24. 

Key Widgets: 

Toss Decision Advisor: Win probability based on venue/opponent1. 

In-Game Simulator: Adjust target scores/overs remaining for win probability. 

python 

# Example: Win probability calculator 
def win_probability(target, current_score, overs_left, wickets): 
required_rate = (target - current_score) / overs_left 
return model.predict([[required_rate, wickets]])[0] 
 

4. Validation & Reporting (Weeks 7-8) 

Test models against historical IPL matches (2016–2023). 

Compare predicted vs actual auction prices (RMSE < 15%). 

Prepare a technical report with DAX/Python code snippets2. 

Where to Start 

Clone Templates: Use GitHub IPL analysis repos1 as baseline code. 

Focus on One Module: Begin with toss decision analysis (simpler MVP). 

Leverage Existing Insights: Incorporate financial sustainability metrics3 for cost-benefit scenarios. 

Key Challenges & Solutions 

Data Gaps: Augment with web-scraped news for player injuries/form. 

Overfitting: Use time-series split validation (train on 2008–2019, test on 2020–2024). 

Stakeholder Buy-In: Align outputs with known IPL pain points (e.g., “death over bowling leaks”). 

This project balances technical depth with practical applicability, making it ideal for showcasing end-to-end data science skills.
