 

Project: IPL Player Valuation & Auction Strategy Analyzer 

This project combines machine learning for player price prediction with auction strategy simulations and interactive visualizations. Perfect for 3 members over 2 months. 

Core Components 

1. Player Valuation Engine (ML Specialist) 

Build regression models to predict player auction prices 

Key features from search results: 

Historical performance metrics (batting avg, economy rate) 

Player role (batter, all-rounder, etc.) 

Age, nationality, T20 experience 

Previous auction prices34 

Models to try: 

XGBoost (best performer in existing projects) 

Ensemble methods (combine team needs + player value) 

Time-series analysis for career trajectories5 

2. Auction Simulator (Data Engineer) 

Interactive tool to: 

Set team budgets (₹90-100 Cr cap) 

Simulate bidding wars 

Optimize team composition 

Features: 

"What-if" scenarios for different strategies 

Real-time budget tracking 

Team balance analyzer (batting depth/bowling variety)6 

3. Strategy Dashboard (Visualization Expert) 

Interactive panel showing: 

Price vs performance metrics 

Team-wise spending analysis 

Value-for-money comparisons 

Historical auction trends (2018-2024) 

Tools: 

Streamlit/Plotly Dash (used successfully in27) 

Power BI for advanced visualizations 

Unique Value Propositions 

Dual Prediction System 

Predict both player price and team likelihood to bid (classification) 

Combine wisdom-of-crowd approach5 with performance metrics 

Auction Impact Analyzer 

Quantify how marquee signings affect team balance 

Salary cap optimization using constraint programming 

Team Strategy Profiler 

Classify teams as "Youth Focused" vs "Star Powered" 

Compare actual bids vs model recommendations6 

Implementation Roadmap
