## 📂 Dataset Sources

### [Kaggle: IPL Ball-by-Ball Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- ✅ **IPL matches from 2008–2019**
- 📊 Detailed ball-by-ball stats including players, deliveries, and results
- 🧩 Merges well with player auction data and external stats

### [CricSheet.org](https://cricsheet.org)
- 🧠 Open-source cricket match data in YAML/CSV
- 🌐 Includes IPL, international T20s, Tests, and ODIs

## 💡 End-to-End ML Project Ideas

1. **🧠 Match Winner Prediction**  
   Features: Toss, team strength, form, venue history

2. **📈 First Innings Score Predictor**  
   Predict 1st innings score based on powerplay, pitch, batting order

3. **👤 Player Performance Forecaster**  
   Predict if player scores 50+/takes 2+ wickets

4. **🧠 Real-Time Win Probability (2nd Innings)**  
   Dynamic model to track chase momentum with over-by-over updates

5. **🌟 Emerging Talent Detector**  
   Discover undervalued or breakout youth players from domestic stats

6. **💰 Auction Price Prediction Engine**  
   Predict auction prices using performance, country, age, and prior stats

7. **🧮 Squad Optimization Tool**  
   Build the strongest team under budget and role constraints
