Football Data Machine Learning Models
Match-Level Predictions
Match Outcome (Win/Draw/Loss)
Description: Predicts the final result of a match (home win / draw / away win) based on historical and match-day data. This multiclass classification model can use team stats, form, and betting odds to assign probabilities to each outcome. (For example, logistic regression is a standard approach for modeling win/loss probabilities​
football-data.co.uk
.)
Features: Team form (recent wins/losses, points streak), head-to-head history, league position/ELO, home vs away advantage, betting odds (implied win probabilities), expected goals (xG) and shots stats for each team​
understat.com
, key player availability (injuries/suspensions), and situational factors (rest days, weather).
Algorithms: Logistic Regression (multi-class), Random Forest, XGBoost (gradient boosting trees), Support Vector Machine, or simple Neural Network. These models have been shown effective for match-outcome prediction​

).
Over/Under Total Goals
Description: Predicts whether the total goals in a match will exceed a certain threshold (e.g. Over 2.5 goals) or predicts the expected number of goals. This can be framed as a binary classification (over vs under) or regression (goal count or goal probability).
Features: Team attacking/defensive strength (goals for/against per game, xG per game​
understat.com
), home/away, league average goals, recent form of scoring, weather/stadium conditions, time of season, plus bookmaker odds for over/under. StatsBomb event data (shots, big chances) or Understat xG can quantify chance quality.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression (for binary over/under), Poisson/Negative Binomial Regression (for count of goals), Random Forest or XGBoost on aggregated features, or even simple ensemble of Poisson models for each team. Gradient boosting trees and decision forests often capture non-linear influences well (form, opponent strength).
Both Teams to Score (BTTS)
Description: Predicts whether both teams will score at least one goal in the match (a common betting market). This is a binary classification (Yes/No).
Features: Each team’s offensive and defensive metrics (e.g. shots on target, xG for and against​
understat.com
), recent scoring trends, head-to-head scoring patterns, home advantage, and odds for BTTS. Injuries to key attackers or defenders can be included.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest or XGBoost classifiers. Models like XGBoost can learn complex patterns (e.g. interaction of both teams’ strengths) and often yield high accuracy on BTTS tasks.
Scoreline Prediction (Exact Score)
Description: Predicts the exact final score (e.g., 2-1, 1-1). This is a multi-class or multi-output regression problem, where each possible scoreline is a class or numeric outcome.
Features: Similar to match outcome features but more granular, including each team’s average goals scored/conceded, expected goals, finishing efficiency, and possibly time-based features (goals by half). Use historic score frequencies and team form.
Algorithms: Multinomial Logistic Regression (with classes for common scores), Random Forest or XGBoost, or Poisson regression for home and away goals (two independent Poisson models) then combine. Ensemble methods or stacking (combining a win/draw/loss model with goal models) can improve accuracy. (These are medium-level tasks since exact scores are numerous, but still feasible with decision-tree ensembles or multi-output models.)
Goal Difference Prediction
Description: Predicts the goal difference in a match (e.g. how many goals the home team wins by, or margin). Can be framed as regression (goal difference) or classification (win by 1, win by 2+, draw).
Features: All features from match outcome (team strengths, xG, odds) plus specific metrics like recent average goal difference, head-to-head scoring margins, and statistical ratings of defense vs offense.
Algorithms: Regression models (e.g. linear regression or gradient boosting for numeric goal difference) or multi-class classification (predicting categories of margin). XGBoost or Random Forest regression often capture non-linear relationships. Alternatively, ordinal regression can model the ordered nature of goal difference.
Corners and Cards Prediction
Description: Predicts discrete match events such as the total number of corner kicks or yellow/red cards. For example, predict whether corners will be over a certain line, or how many yellow cards in a match.
Features: Team playstyle stats (average corners earned/conceded, fouls, cards), referee tendencies (some referees give more cards), match importance, and match context (rivalry, injuries). Bookmaker lines for corners/cards can also be features.
Algorithms: Poisson or Negative Binomial regression for count data, or logistic regression on a threshold (e.g., over 10 corners). Decision trees or Random Forest can handle interactions (e.g. certain referees + aggressive teams). This is moderately difficult due to lower predictability, but feasible with ensemble methods.
Player-Level Predictions
Next-Game Goal/Assist Prediction (Player Performance)
Description: Predicts whether a given player will score or assist in the next match (binary or count) or how many goal contributions they’ll have. This estimates individual performance based on history.
Features: Player’s season-to-date stats (goals, assists, shots, xG, xA, minutes played)​
github.com
; form (recent appearances and contributions); playing position and role; team’s offensive strength; opponent defensive strength; match location (home/away); expected minutes (e.g. starting likelihood). Also include underlying quality metrics (expected goals from StatsBomb, expected assists, key passes).
Algorithms: Logistic Regression (probability of a goal/assist) or Poisson regression for count of goals/assists, or Random Forest / XGBoost if combining multiple features. An LSTM or RNN could be used if modeling the time-series of player form (recent games as sequence) for better temporal patterns.
Clean Sheet Prediction (Defenders/Goalkeepers)
Description: Predicts whether a team will keep a clean sheet (no goals conceded), which directly impacts defender/goalkeeper performance. This is often framed for the team (binary) or for an individual (if the player plays full match).
Features: Team defensive metrics (shots against, xGA, tackles, intercepts), opponent attack metrics, lineup strength, home advantage, and players’ historical clean sheet rates. Injuries to defenders or goalkeepers and any off-field factors (e.g. new manager) can be included.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression or tree-based classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict clean sheet probability. Alternatively, a gradient boosting model on team-level features. Models can incorporate understat/xG data for defensive solidity.
Playing Time / Starting Likelihood
Description: Predicts whether a player will start or how many minutes they will play in the next match (binary or regression). This helps gauge whether a player contributes at all.
Features: Recent playing time trends, manager rotation patterns (e.g. substitution frequency), player fitness (recent injuries or minutes, age), club schedule congestion (rest days, multiple games), and opponent strength. Squad depth (e.g. competition for positions) and formation changes are also relevant. Historical data from Football-Data and line-ups from StatsBomb can indicate past selection.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression for starting vs bench, or Random Forest / XGBoost with many features. Regression trees can model playtime minutes as well. Because playing time can depend on context, ensemble methods often work well.
Player Market Value Prediction
Description: Predicts a player’s market value (e.g. from Transfermarkt) or future changes in value. This is a regression problem useful for transfers.
Features: Age, position, nationality, current market value (log-transformed), contract length, and performance statistics (goals per 90, assists, defensive actions, etc.). Club factors (league, club reputation) and recent performance trends also matter.
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest or XGBoost regression. Studies show that linear models and Random Forests are effective for market-value prediction​

. For example, one approach builds a regression on Transfermarkt data using age, position, goals/assists per 90, etc.​
kritjunsree.medium.com
. Ensemble methods can capture non-linear age curves and performance interactions.
Injury Risk Prediction
Description: Estimates the probability that a player will get injured (or miss games) in the near future. This classification model can help manage squad rotation and fantasy transfers.
Features: Player age, position, injury history, minutes workload (past few games), rest periods, and physical data if available (e.g. from tracking, though that’s beyond our listed datasets). Congestion of fixtures and number of games played in a short time can be included. (Soccer analytics research often combines biomechanical and wellness data for injury models.)
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost classification. These models can handle the varied inputs (e.g. age × minutes interactions). In sports injury literature, decision-tree ensembles (Random Forest/XGBoost) have been used successfully to identify key risk factors (with accuracies often above 70%)​

.
Yellow/Red Card Prediction
Description: Predicts the likelihood a player will receive a yellow or red card in a match (binary or count).
Features: Player’s historical card rate, playing position (defenders/midfielders get more), aggression or foul statistics, referee identity (some refs give more cards), match importance, and league style. Team discipline statistics can also be aggregated.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression or Random Forest/XGBoost (for rare event classification). Models may need techniques like upsampling or focal loss due to imbalanced classes. For count predictions, a Poisson regression or regression tree can be used.
Fantasy Football Predictions
Fantasy Points Prediction (Per Player)
Description: Predicts a player’s fantasy football points for the upcoming gameweek or match. Fantasy points combine goals, assists, clean sheets, etc., so this model forecasts overall fantasy score.
Features: Player’s historical fantasy points per match and season (rolling averages up to current week)​
github.com
, underlying stats (goals, assists, clean sheets, minutes), position (since scoring rules differ by position), team attack/defense strength, opponent difficulty, home/away, and current form. Include features for bonus points (e.g. shots on target, key passes) if available from StatsBomb. Injuries and lineup announcements are also important.
Algorithms: Regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Elastic Net) to predict numeric points. Random Forests and XGBoost are common due to nonlinear interactions. One can also use time-series models (LSTM/RNN) to capture sequential form trends​
github.com
. Multilayer Perceptron neural nets or ensemble models (stacking multiple regressors) can further improve accuracy.
Captaincy Value Prediction
Description: Predicts which player (among one’s squad) will yield the highest points if chosen as captain (i.e. double points). This can be framed as ranking players by expected points or as a classification (will this player exceed a high threshold).
Features: Same as fantasy points above, focusing on players who are likely to start. Also include volatility (goal-scoring probability vs consistency) and home/away (captains often from home team or top team). Fixture uniqueness (double gameweeks) could be included in season-long models.
Algorithms: Use the fantasy points model to rank players; or train a binary classifier for “will exceed X points” and pick the top. Algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost (for regression/ranking) work well. One could also use pairwise learning-to-rank models, but a simpler approach is to predict points and compare.
Gameweek Total Points Prediction (Team/League)
Description: Predicts the total fantasy points scored by a user’s team or predicts league ranking changes. This is a higher-level aggregation.
Features: Sum of individual predicted points (from above), bench strength, team’s budget (affects squad strength), captaincy decisions, and transfers made. Also league difficulty (e.g. if many players on good fixtures).
Algorithms: Regression (e.g. linear or tree-based on aggregated features). Alternatively, treat as sum of predictions: sum the predicted points of selected players and apply corrections for captaincy and bench. Ensemble methods can capture interactions (e.g. poor performance of key players drags down total).
Transfer/Selection Advice (Differential Picks)
Description: Suggests which players to transfer in/out by predicting their future value (points) and popularity. For example, predict which under-owned player will outperform (a “differential”).
Features: Player expected points (from the above model), current ownership percentage, price trends (from Transfermarkt/FPL data), and fixture run difficulty. Use form and upcoming fixtures as predictors.
Algorithms: Classification (will this player return high points) or clustering (group high-value differentials). Random Forest or XGBoost can identify under-the-radar players with good stats. A bipartite matching or recommendation system could also be envisioned, but even a simple decision rule (high expected points, low ownership) is effective.
In-Season Player Value Change (Fantasy Market)
Description: Predicts changes in a player’s fantasy value (price rises/falls in-game currency) or popularity during the season. This helps in timing transfers.
Features: Recent performance (goals, form), number of transfers in/out (market movement), price (cheap players move faster), and fixture schedule (players in tough fixtures may fall).
Algorithms: Regression or time-series models (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting) on price, or classification (will player rise in price). Models from football transfer forecasting can be adapted (using historical data of price changes).
